    "her father's lab. Having accidentally slowed her mother and " +
    "fatherâ€™s timelines out of synch with the rest of the world by " +
    "a fraction of a second, they have disappeared from the present" +
    ". She has now spent her adult life covering their " +
    "disappearance while trying to develop the technology that " +
    "will speed them back into the present. The breakthroughs she " +
    "has made allowed her to continue and fund her work " +
    "uninterrupted until the greedy military-industrial complex " +
    "discovered the technology she has been unwilling to release " +
    "on moral grounds. Teaming up with the Launcher League, she " +
    "continues her work, aides them in theirs, and protects the " +
    "world from the mayhem greed would unleash if it were ever " +
    "given the chance."
